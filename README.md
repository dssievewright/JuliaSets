# Julia Sets

I'm creating some functions to try out plotting a variety of Julia sets in high detail.  For right now, I'm adding some work that I have done and hope to get more detailed and sophisticated plots (more colors, linear programming) in the future.  For now, just check out what I have and if you have any comments/questions, feel free to email me at:

In the Juliaplots_nodocs folder, I have a bunch of plots but I didn't document them.  At some point, these will be deleted once I have a few more plots with proper documentation (which function I used and the parameters).

In the Juliaplots_withdocs, I do have the plots better documented.  Note that the functions from Julia.R must be read into R before sourcing the R files in Juliaplots_withdocs.
